### How It Works
1. **Register** for an account and **log in**.
2. Start by creating areas such as Work, Study, Exercise, or other categories relevant to your daily life.
3. **Log activities** throughout the day, specifying the name of the activity, start and end times, and the relevant area.
4. The app will automatically calculate the **time spent** on each activity and provide a total for each day.
5. Use the **history page** to review past logs and analyze your time usage.

This project aims to improve daily productivity by making users more aware of how they allocate their time. By tracking activities in specific areas, users can reflect on their habits, set goals, and work toward a balanced, productive lifestyle.
